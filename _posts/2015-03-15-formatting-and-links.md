abstract: >
  In this first lecture, we give an introduction to graphical models.
  We begin by discussing the three fundamental question types that graphical models can help us answer: representation, inference, and learning.
  We then show how graphical models can incorporate domain knowledge, fuse heterogeneous data, and support Bayesian inferences.
  Subsequently, we define the two types of graphical models (directed and undirected) and show that model graph traversal can yield independence relationships (the Equivalence Theorem).
  We conclude with examples of fancier models as well as application areas.
